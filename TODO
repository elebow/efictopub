ebooklib MR: stop automatically setting dcterms:modified if it's being set manually
ffnet category and property. Append in brackets to title?
general --options arg that gets passed to the fetcher class?
	minimum length of forum post to consider a chapter, reddit author pattern, etc
	title for fetchers that have trouble automatically detecting title (reddit fetchers)
	some are required, like `title` for reddit fetchers
"update" operation. Fetch new chapters.
verbose mode (or dry-run mode?) that prints all the config settings at the beginning of execution (and then exits?)
require --clobber if the output epub already exists
